Image processing has multiple applications, using machine learning models and different strategies to process information effectively to be applied in autonomous vehicles, social media, and security. This project objective is to process images that are based on the Lego’s life of George. The images are 4x4 boards with colors red, blue, white, and yellow. To achieve this an algorithm in MATLAB is proposed. The algorithm is made of the functions findColors, loadImage, findCircles, correctImage and getColors. These functions will be explained, the logic of the functions, design decisions and suggestions to improve algorithm’s performance.
